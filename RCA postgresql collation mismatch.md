Absolutely, here's a clear and professional **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)** for the PostgreSQL collation version mismatch issue affecting your Backstage deployment in PROD.

## üßæ **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)**

**Issue Title:**
Backstage failed to start in PROD due to PostgreSQL collation version mismatch during plugin database creation.

---

### üîç **Summary**

On deploying a new version of Backstage to the **production environment**, the application failed to start due to a PostgreSQL error when attempting to create a new plugin-specific database (`backstage_plugin_kubernetes`). The same deployment worked fine in SIT and UAT environments.

---

### üß® **Error Observed**

```
CREATE DATABASE backstage_plugin_kubernetes template database "template1" has a collation version mismatch
```

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **Root Cause**

* **PostgreSQL uses `template1`** as the base for creating new databases.
* PostgreSQL stores the **collation version** (from the OS's glibc) in each database when it is created.
* In the **PROD environment**, the glibc version on the host OS was updated (e.g., due to OS upgrade or patching).
* However, the `template1` database in PostgreSQL was created with an **older collation version** and was **not refreshed** after the glibc update.
* When Backstage attempted to create a new database using `template1`, **PostgreSQL blocked the operation** due to the **mismatch in collation versions**, to prevent data inconsistencies.

---

### ‚úÖ **Resolution**

* Ran the following SQL command as a PostgreSQL superuser:

  ```sql
  ALTER DATABASE template1 REFRESH COLLATION VERSION;
  ```

* This command updated the internal metadata (`datcollversion`) of `template1` to match the current system glibc version.

* After this, the Backstage deployment proceeded without error.

---

### üîé **Why This Was Not Seen in SIT/UAT**

* SIT and UAT environments likely run:

  * On different base images or OS versions (glibc not upgraded).
  * Or PostgreSQL instances that were initialized more recently, already using the correct collation version.

### üß™ **Impact**

| Impact Area           | Description                                |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Affected Environments | Production only                            |
| Services Down         | Backstage Developer Portal failed to start |
| Data Loss             | ‚ùå No data loss                             |
| Security Risk         | ‚ùå None                                     |

### üì¶ **Preventive Actions**

1. **Add a health check for PostgreSQL collation version consistency** as part of future deployment validation.
2. Document and automate the use of:

   ```sql
   SELECT datname, datcollversion FROM pg_database;
   ```

   ‚Ä¶to verify collation version consistency across environments.
3. After any **OS upgrade or glibc change**, run:

   ```sql
   ALTER DATABASE template1 REFRESH COLLATION VERSION;
   ```

   ‚Ä¶as a post-maintenance task.
4. Consider using **template0** for critical DB creation where possible to avoid inheritance issues (advanced).
5. Standardize glibc versions across SIT, UAT, and PROD to minimize environment drift.

### üìÖ **Timeline**

| Time (SGT) | Event                                                          |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| T+0 mins   | Backstage deployment started in PROD                           |
| T+2 mins   | Application failed with `collation version mismatch`           |
| T+30 mins  | Issue analyzed and root cause identified                       |
| T+45 mins  | `ALTER DATABASE template1 REFRESH COLLATION VERSION;` executed |
| T+50 mins  | Backstage came up successfully                                 |

---

### üß† **Lessons Learned**

* Even minor system library changes (like glibc) can affect PostgreSQL behavior.
* PostgreSQL 13+ tracks collation versions ‚Äî which is good for safety but must be maintained proactively.
* Always test critical infra upgrades in non-PROD environments with realistic workloads.
